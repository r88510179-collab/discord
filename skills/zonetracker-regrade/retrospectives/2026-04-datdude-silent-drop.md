# DatDude `#datdude-slips` silent-drop debug — investigation

**Date:** 2026-04-30
**Production target:** `bettracker-discord-bot` on Fly (machine v330, iad).
**Tooling baseline:** migration 018 + 021 (`pipeline_events`), shipped in v289 on 2026-04-17.
**Scope:** read-only investigation. No code changes proposed for this session — fix proposal documented but not written.

> **Bottom line up front.** The original premise (ig-dave-picks works, datdude-slips silently drops) is partially out-of-date. Both channels currently fail to produce bets. Vision AI returns `is_bet: false` ("ignore") for Hard Rock Bet share images framed by HRB boilerplate text, and the existing Gemma vision fallback does not trigger on the `ignore` verdict — so suspected bets die at the AI without reaching war-room. The instrumentation does record this as `PRE_FILTER_NO_BET_CONTENT / ai_is_bet_false`, so the drops are no longer silent in `pipeline_events`, just silent in the user's perception.

## ERRATA-2 (added 2026-04-30, third correction)

**This is the second ERRATA on this retrospective.** ERRATA-1 was a proposed correction (drafted in `prompts/datdude-fix.md`) that itself misidentified the failure path; it was caught during pre-implementation verification and never written into this file. ERRATA-2 supersedes it.

### What was wrong before

Both the original retrospective and the rejected ERRATA-1 draft pointed at the wrong location:

- **Original (Section 4.3 + Section 5 H4):** claimed Vision AI returns `type: 'ignore'` for HRB images and the existing Gemma gate doesn't catch that. Proposed fixing the gate to also fire on `type: 'ignore'`. Symptom-pattern correct (silent perception); root cause wrong.
- **ERRATA-1 (rejected):** claimed HRB image-attached posts go through `parseBetSlipImage` (which has no fallback gate) while text-with-image-URL posts go through `parseBetText` (which has one). Proposed mirroring the gate into `parseBetSlipImage`. **Wrong on call-path:** an exhaustive `grep -rn parseBetSlipImage` shows the only non-test caller is `handlers/messageHandler.js:441` inside `scanImage()`, and `scanImage()` is dead code — never invoked anywhere in the repo since the initial commit. `parseBetSlipImage` is not on any production path. Implementing ERRATA-1 would have been a no-op deploy.

### Actual production path

HRB image-attached posts to `#datdude-slips` flow through:

```
discord.js Message event
  → handlers/messageHandler.js handleMessage (line 668)
  → bufferMessage / flushBuffer
  → processAggregatedMessage (line 876)
  → parseBetText(textPrompt, imageUrl, { imageUrl })  [line 949 or 960]
  → returns to processAggregatedMessage
  → recordStage('PARSED', { type, isBet, betCount, ... })  [line 984]
  → branches: result / untracked_win / ticket_status / is_bet===false / bets.length>0
```

`parseBetText` has the Gemma fallback gate at [services/ai.js:868-906](../../../services/ai.js#L868). The gate works correctly for its intended trigger conditions: placeholder text, `raw === null`, and JSON-with-zero-legs when `quick.type === 'bet' || quick.is_bet === true`.

### The actual silent-drop point

Test posts on 2026-04-30 by user (smokke5) into `#datdude-slips`:

| time (UTC) | source_ref | trace |
|---|---|---|
| 04:05:47 | `disc_1499260454038667264` | HRB image attachment |
| 04:06:32 | `disc_1499260646183796796` | text "test" |

Both traces, pulled from `pipeline_events` (timestamps converted from `created_at` epoch using `strftime('%s', ...)` — not the broken `datetime('now', '-7 days')` filter that produced Section 1's bogus row counts):

**Test post 1 (HRB image, the failing case):**
```
RECEIVED   → channelId=1355182920163262664, channelName=datdude-slips
AUTHORIZED → guardReason=human_ok
BUFFERED   → ─
EXTRACTED  → imageCount=1, imageUrl=https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/.../ReactNative-snapshot-image461681713155507
PARSED     → {"type":"bet","isBet":false,"betCount":0,"ticketStatus":"new"}
[no further events]
```

**Test post 2 (plain text "test", control):**
```
RECEIVED   → channelId=1355182920163262664
AUTHORIZED → guardReason=human_ok
DROPPED    → PRE_FILTER_NO_BET_CONTENT (textLen=4)  ← visible drop
```

The control post's pre-filter drop is recorded explicitly. The HRB post reaches PARSED with `betCount=0` and then **emits no further events** — no DROPPED, no STAGED, no ERROR.

### Why the silent exit happens

[handlers/messageHandler.js:1084](../../../handlers/messageHandler.js#L1084):

```js
// Not a bet — silently ignore
if (parsed.is_bet === false) {
  console.log(`[Filter] AI rejected as non-bet: ${cleanText.substring(0, 60)}...`);
  dropAll('DROPPED', 'PRE_FILTER_NO_BET_CONTENT', { filter: 'ai_is_bet_false', sample: cleanText.slice(0, 80) });
  return;
}

if (parsed.bets?.length > 0) { ... }  // line 1090
```

`parsed.is_bet === false` is **strict equality**. When `parsed.is_bet === undefined`, the check is false — `dropAll` doesn't fire. The next branch (`parsed.bets?.length > 0`) is also false when bets is empty. Control falls out of the `if (cleanText.length > 5 || imageUrls.length > 0)` block, past the `allBets`/`reviewBets` empty checks at lines 1148/1156, exits the function with no terminal pipeline event written.

`parsed.is_bet` ends up undefined when `parseBetText` returns from its **Type 1 Bet** path at [services/ai.js:941-944](../../../services/ai.js#L941):

```js
const result = applyConfidenceGating(normalizeParsedBets(parsed), text);
result.type = 'bet';
return result;
```

`normalizeParsedBets` returns `{ bets: clean }` only — no `is_bet` field. `applyConfidenceGating` mutates per-bet flags but doesn't add `is_bet`. The Type 1 path explicitly sets `result.type = 'bet'` but leaves `is_bet` unset.

This path fires when the Vision AI returns valid JSON with `is_bet: true` and `bets: [{...,legs:[<at least one>]}]`, but `normalizeBet` ([services/ai.js:367-368](../../../services/ai.js#L367)) drops every bet because the top-level `description` is empty/whitespace:

```js
const rawDesc = String(bet.description || '').trim().slice(0, 250);
if (!rawDesc) return null;
```

After `.filter(Boolean)`, `result.bets = []`. Returned object: `{ type: 'bet', bets: [] }` — **no `is_bet`**.

### Why the Gemma gate didn't fire (and why that's a separate issue)

The gate at [services/ai.js:868-906](../../../services/ai.js#L868) only marks `noLegsFound = true` when:

```js
if (quick && (quick.type === 'bet' || quick.is_bet === true)) {
  const bets = Array.isArray(quick.bets) ? quick.bets : [];
  noLegsFound = bets.length === 0 || !bets.some(b => Array.isArray(b.legs) && b.legs.length > 0);
}
```

For our scenario the AI returned `bets: [{description: "", legs: [<at least one>]}]`. The gate sees `bets.length > 0` and `bets[0].legs.length > 0` → `noLegsFound = false` → `shouldFallback = false` → **gate skips**. The gate has no awareness that the bet's top-level description is empty (which is what `normalizeBet` will reject on downstream).

Confirmation that Gemma was not invoked: **`vision_failures` has zero rows** in the 04:00–04:15 UTC window (`run-fly-sql.sh`). `runGemmaVisionFallback` calls `logVisionFailure` on every Gemma-stage failure path (env-missing, circuit-breaker open, HTTP error, timeout, empty response, cerebras-parse failure). Zero rows → gate did not call `runGemmaVisionFallback` → gate did not fire.

The most recent `vision_failures` entry is from 2026-04-29 19:27:05 UTC (~9 h before the test) and all 10 most-recent entries are `pbs.twimg.com/...` Twitter images, never `cdn.discordapp.com` Discord attachments — circumstantial evidence that the gate has not fired for any Discord-attachment post in this window.

### Updated diagnosis (supersedes Sections 4.3, 5 H4, and ERRATA-1)

The HRB silent-drop bug has **two independent contributing defects**:

1. **Primary (the silent exit):** [handlers/messageHandler.js:1084](../../../handlers/messageHandler.js#L1084) `parsed.is_bet === false` is strict-equal where it should accept `undefined` as the "ignored" case, OR the path needs an explicit fall-through drop when `parsed.bets.length === 0` after the type/result branches. As-is, any `parseBetText` return shape with undefined `is_bet` and empty `bets` exits silently with PARSED as the last recorded event.

2. **Contributing (Gemma gate blind spot):** [services/ai.js:868-906](../../../services/ai.js#L868) gates on legs presence only. When the AI returns bet entries with populated legs but empty top-level descriptions, `normalizeBet` will subsequently strip them — but the gate has already decided not to invoke Gemma. A bet-level `description` check (or moving the gate to fire on `bets.length === 0` *after* `normalizeParsedBets`) would close this hole.

Defect 1 is the silent-drop. Defect 2 is why Gemma never gets a second swing at slips that the primary AI returned with empty descriptions.

### What the qualitative findings got right

The retrospective's qualitative conclusions still hold and are reinforced by ERRATA-2:

- **"Gemma fallback never fires for HRB images"** — confirmed (vision_failures has no Discord-attachment entries; gate doesn't trigger on the description-stripping path).
- **"pipeline_events has a blind spot in AI processing path"** — confirmed (`services/ai.js` has zero `recordStage` calls; intermediate gate/Gemma decisions are not observable).

What's wrong is the location and mechanism, not the symptom-pattern.

### Validation pending

The diagnosis above is high-confidence based on code-trace + pipeline_events evidence, but is not directly proven by AI response content (the `raw` string is not persisted). Definitive proof requires either:

- (a) instrumented re-test that captures `raw` and the post-`normalizeBet` bet count, OR
- (b) a one-shot diagnostic that adds `recordStage` between `callLLM` and `normalizeParsedBets` in `parseBetText` to log the pre-normalize bets array, lands as a temporary instrumentation deploy, and is reviewed against a fresh HRB test post.

Both options are out of scope for this read-only retrospective — the next session will write the fix prompt against this diagnosis.

---

**Update — v335 / commit 289ce3b:** addresses defect 1 (loose `is_bet` check + new `PRE_FILTER_AI_RESPONSE_NOT_A_BET` drop reason + secondary `PRE_FILTER_AI_RETURNED_ZERO_BETS` guard) and adds diagnostic instrumentation to `parseBetText` (AI_RESPONSE_RAW, GATE_DECISION, GEMMA_FALLBACK_TRIGGERED, GEMMA_FALLBACK_RESULT, NORMALIZE_INPUT, NORMALIZE_OUTPUT). Defect 2 (Gemma gate blind spot for empty-description bets) awaits raw payload data captured by AI_RESPONSE_RAW + NORMALIZE_INPUT in this deploy and lands in the next deploy.

---

## ERRATA-3 (added 2026-04-30, fourth correction — supersedes the v335 footnote conclusions)

**The v335 deploy (commit 289ce3b) introduced a regression that dropped every Type 1 bet at the new `PRE_FILTER_AI_RESPONSE_NOT_A_BET` filter. Rolled back to v334's image as v337. Defect 2's empty-description hypothesis is disproven by the AI_RESPONSE_RAW data captured during the v335 window.**

### What v335 actually did

The defect 1 fix in `handlers/messageHandler.js:1086` replaced strict `parsed.is_bet === false` with loose `parsed.is_bet !== true`. The intended semantic was *"the AI explicitly said is_bet:false → drop."* The implemented semantic was *"the AI didn't explicitly say is_bet:true → drop."* These are not equivalent, because `parseBetText`'s Type 1 path returns `{ type:'bet', bets:[...] }` with `is_bet` left undefined as the **steady state** for every successful Type 1 return — not only the empty-bets edge case the original ERRATA-2 narrative described.

`normalizeParsedBets` ([services/ai.js:421](../../../services/ai.js#L421)) returns `{ bets: clean }` only. `applyConfidenceGating` ([services/ai.js:546](../../../services/ai.js#L546)) mutates per-bet `_confidence*` fields and returns `result` unchanged in shape. Neither sets `is_bet`. The Type 1 path at `services/ai.js:997` then sets `result.type = 'bet'` and returns. Every Type 1 return has `is_bet === undefined`, regardless of `bets.length`. The v335 check therefore dropped them all.

### The v335 trace that revealed the bug

Test post into `#datdude-slips` at 2026-04-30 ~05:26 UTC, source_ref `1499280867540078633`:

```
RECEIVED            channelName=datdude-slips
AUTHORIZED          guardReason=human_ok
BUFFERED
EXTRACTED           imageCount=1

                    is_bet_value="undefined", parsedType="bet", betCount=1
```

The full AI raw response (rawLen=330, captured complete in `rawSnippet`):

```json
{"type":"bet","is_bet":true,"ticket_status":"loser","bets":[{"sport":"MLB","league":"MLB","bet_type":"straight","description":"Rangers TO WIN","odds":"+100","units":1.0,"wager":2.0,"payout":null,"event_date":null,"legs":[{"description":"Rangers TO WIN","odds":"+100","team":"Rangers","line":"ML","type":"moneyline"}],"props":[]}]}
```

`NORMALIZE_INPUT.sampleBet` (post-AI parse, pre-normalize):

```json
{"sport":"MLB","league":"MLB","bet_type":"straight","description":"Rangers TO WIN","odds":"+100","units":1,"wager":2,"payout":null,"event_date":null,"legs":[{"description":"Rangers TO WIN","odds":"+100","team":"Rangers","line":"ML","type":"moneyline"}],"props":[]}
```

### What this proves (and disproves)

- **Defect 2 hypothesis is disproven.** ERRATA-2's diagnosis claimed AI returns `bets:[{description:"", legs:[<populated>]}]` and `normalizeBet` strips them via the `if (!rawDesc) return null;` guard. The v335 capture shows the opposite: `description="Rangers TO WIN"` (non-empty), the leg is populated with `team:"Rangers", line:"ML", type:"moneyline"`, and `NORMALIZE_OUTPUT.betCount` matches `NORMALIZE_INPUT.betCount` at 1 — `normalizeBet` did **not** strip. The empty-top-level-description failure mode did not reproduce. It may be intermittent, or it may not be the actual failure mode at all.
- **Defect 1 fix in 289ce3b is wrong.** The check is too loose. Under v334, the Rangers ML bet would have flowed past `parsed.is_bet === false` (false; undefined !== false), entered `if (parsed.bets?.length > 0)`, and been staged. Under v335 it was dropped before reaching the bets block.
- **The original "two-defect" framing is no longer supported.** ERRATA-2 split the bug into (1) silent exit in messageHandler and (2) Gemma gate blind spot. The v335 capture undermines both: the trace would have produced a normal staged bet under v334, so it is unclear which posts actually exhibit the originally-reported silent drop, and the AI did not produce the shape that defect 2's gate-fix targets.

### What is still unexplained

The original retrospective documented an HRB image post at 2026-04-30 04:05:47 UTC where `PARSED` had `betCount=0` and no terminal event followed. The Rangers ML test (2026-04-30 ~05:26 UTC) does not reproduce that — the AI returned `betCount=1`. Possible explanations, none yet evidenced:

- The earlier HRB slip image triggered the AI to return `bets:[]` or `is_bet:false` (untriggered by the test image used in v335).
- A different normalize-strip path (something other than empty top-level description) zeroed the bets.
- The "no terminal event" symptom was caused by an exception or async-orphan in the bet-staging path, not in `parseBetText`.

The captured AI_RESPONSE_RAW for the Rangers slip is a single sample; the failure mode may be input-dependent.

### What the next session should do

1. **Re-read the original BACKLOG entry / the field reports that motivated this investigation.** The v335 trace makes it possible the bug is not where ERRATA-1 or ERRATA-2 located it.
2. **Trace what would happen to the Rangers ML bet AFTER PARSED in the original (v334) flow.** v335 instrumentation stopped at the PARSED → drop boundary in messageHandler; the bet-creation path (`createBetWithLegs`, `validateParsedBet`, war-room post in [handlers/messageHandler.js:1118-1163](../../../handlers/messageHandler.js#L1118)) is not instrumented. If the silent drop happens *there* instead of in `parseBetText`, the v335 instrumentation would never catch it.
3. **Add instrumentation on the bet-staging path** for the next investigation deploy: between PARSED and `createBetWithLegs`, around `validateParsedBet`, between `createBetWithLegs` and the `recordStage('STAGED')` call. Mirror the `evtCtx`-style optionality so non-instrumented callers no-op.
4. **Do not write a new fix prompt yet.** The next deploy should be instrumentation-only, no behavior changes — until the bug location is confirmed by a fresh trace.

### Hard rule for any subsequent prompt against this retrospective

Any future "loosen the is_bet check" proposal must include a paired change that preserves the populated-bets path. Either:

- (a) order checks so `bets.length > 0` is evaluated before any drop on `is_bet`, OR
- (b) combine the conditions: drop only when `is_bet !== true && (!bets || bets.length === 0)`, OR
- (c) revisit the prompt's current hard rule against setting `result.is_bet = true` on the Type 1 path — the v335 trace evidence may justify making the parser's return shape consistent with the messageHandler's expectations.

The implemented v335 fix did none of (a), (b), or (c), and that is what produced the regression.

## Section 1 — Tooling validation

`pipeline_events` is healthy. Schema and counts confirmed via the new helper `skills/zonetracker-regrade/scripts/run-fly-sql.sh` (readonly, blocks DDL/DML at the client before sending to Fly).

**Schema** (10 cols, post-migration 021):

| col | type | notnull |
|---|---|---|
| id | INTEGER | PK |
| ingest_id | TEXT | nullable (021) |
| bet_id | TEXT | nullable |
| source_type | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| source_ref | TEXT | nullable |
| stage | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| event_type | TEXT | NOT NULL |
| drop_reason | TEXT | nullable |
| payload | TEXT | nullable (JSON) |
| created_at | INTEGER | unix epoch |

There is **no `channel_id` column.** For `source_type='discord'`, `source_ref` is the Discord message id and `channelId` is embedded in the `payload` JSON (only at RECEIVED / AUTHORIZED / BUFFERED — post-buffer stages omit it). Cross-stage channel attribution requires joining via `source_ref → RECEIVED.payload.channelId`.

**Row counts:**
- Last 24h: **1,081** rows
- Last 7d: **6,322** rows
- All-time: **10,673** rows
- Earliest event: `2026-04-17 20:40:01` UTC (matches v289 deploy)
- Latest event: `2026-04-30 03:45:30` UTC (live)

**Event types (24h):** `DROP=544`, `STAGE_ENTER=493`, `STAGE_EXIT=44`. Drop volume slightly exceeds enter — explained by drops emitted "for every underlying source_ref in the buffer" via the `dropAll` helper (handlers/messageHandler.js:885).

**Stages observed (24h):** `GRADING_AI=362`, `RECEIVED=181`, `DROPPED=128`, `AUTHORIZED=96`, `PARSED=74`, `EXTRACTED=68`, `GRADING_DROPPED=54`, `BUFFERED=52`, `STAGED=33`, `VALIDATED=33`. Both ingest-side and grading-side stages are firing.

**Source types (24h):** `discord=520`, `grading=416`, `twitter=145`. Discord ingest is the dominant traffic.

Tooling is sound. Investigation proceeds on solid evidence.

## Section 2 — Channel divergence query

Side-by-side, all-time (since v289):

| metric | `#datdude-slips` (1355182920163262664) | `#ig-dave-picks` (1473347391284576469) |
|---|---|---|
| `pipeline_events` rows total | **0** | 15 |
| Distinct messages (source_ref) | 0 | 5 |
| RECEIVED events | 0 | 5 |
| AUTHORIZED events | 0 | 5 |
| BUFFERED events | 0 | 5 |
| EXTRACTED events | 0 | 5 |
| PARSED events | 0 | 5 |
| DROP events | 0 | 5 (all post-PARSED) |
| Bets created (all-time) | 1 (2026-04-13, pre-v289) | 1 (2026-04-06, pre-v289) |
| Bets created since v289 | **0** | **0** |

**Interpretation.** The divergence the user observed is real, but the framing of "ig-dave-picks works, datdude-slips drops" no longer holds: **both channels are silently dropping every post since v289 deployed**, just with different observability.

- ig-dave-picks: 5 datdudestill posts entered the pipeline, all reached Vision AI, all dropped at the AI / validator stage. Drop reasons are now visible in `pipeline_events`.
- datdude-slips: 0 events period. Either DatDude has not posted in that channel since 2026-04-17, or messages are being lost upstream of `recordStage('RECEIVED')` (which is the very first line of `handleMessage`, before any guard). The backlog claim that "MessageHandler.ENTRY fires for both channels" was almost certainly observed pre-v289 and has not been re-verified against `pipeline_events`.

The original "Vision AI fires successfully but no bet appears" hypothesis is contradicted by the data: in 4 of 5 ig-dave-picks messages, Vision AI **does not** classify the image as a bet (`type: 'ignore', is_bet: false`).

---

## Section 3 — Sample bet traces

Only 5 message traces exist in scope. **No traces are available for `#datdude-slips`** — the channel has zero `pipeline_events` rows since instrumentation began. This is a finding, not a tooling gap: the entry-side instrumentation works, it just has nothing to record.

### DATDUDE-SLIPS traces

None. Zero `pipeline_events` rows for this channel since v289 deploy.

The single all-time bet from this channel (`a498c1008b111304ec27727e16be60d3`, source_message_id `1493331402098343986`, 2026-04-13 19:25:59) predates the instrumentation by four days.

**Anchor data point.** The single ig-dave-picks bet that **did** succeed (2026-04-06, source_message_id `1490824276914212926`) has `raw_text: "Check out this bet I placed on Hard Rock Bet!"` — **identical** to the boilerplate in all 5 failed messages. Vision AI is non-deterministic on this exact-shape input: same wrapper, same author, same channel, but only 1 of 6 historical attempts produced a bet.

`handleMessage` at [messageHandler.js:668](handlers/messageHandler.js:668) emits RECEIVED on line 671 — the very first action, before any guard or filter. If a Discord MessageCreate event reaches `bot.js → handleMessage(message)`, RECEIVED fires. There is no code path between `client.on(Events.MessageCreate, …)` ([bot.js:245](bot.js:245)) and `recordStage(RECEIVED)` other than the IGNORED_CHANNELS fast-path ([bot.js:247](bot.js:247)) — and `1355182920163262664` is **not** in `IGNORED_CHANNELS` per prod env. So zero RECEIVED events for datdude-slips means **no messages have reached the bot from that channel since v289**, OR Discord is not delivering messages from that channel to the bot's gateway.

### 4.2 Buffer keying — no collision possible

[messageHandler.js:29](handlers/messageHandler.js:29):
```js
const key = `${message.author.id}:${message.channel.id}`;
```
Buffer is keyed by `(authorId, channelId)`. Same author posting in two different channels uses two distinct keys — no cross-channel collision. **H1 falsified.**

### 4.3 Vision-AI ignore verdict bypasses the Gemma fallback

[services/ai.js:874–906](services/ai.js:874): the `parseBetText` vision fallback decides whether to retry with Gemma+Cerebras based on:
- `!raw` → fallback
- `hasPlaceholder` (e.g. "missing legs", "capper hid") → fallback
- `noLegsFound` (computed only when `quick.type === 'bet'` or `quick.is_bet === true`) → fallback

When the primary returns `{type: 'ignore', is_bet: false, bets: []}`, **none** of these triggers fire. The `noLegsFound` block is gated on `quick.type === 'bet' || quick.is_bet === true` — so an `ignore` verdict skips the check entirely. There is no fallback for "AI dismissed the image as non-bet."

This is the root cause of 4/5 ig-dave-picks drops.

### 4.4 Validator entity check ignores `hasMedia`

[services/ai.js:1288–1304](services/ai.js:1288): `validateParsedBet` runs an entity-mismatch check against `sourceText`:
```js
if (src.length > 10 && desc.length > 10) {
  const betWords = desc.match(/\b[a-z]{4,}\b/g) || [];
  const NOISE = new Set([...]);
  const keyWords = betWords.filter(w => !NOISE.has(w) && w.length >= 4);
  if (keyWords.length >= 2) {
    const matchCount = keyWords.filter(w => src.includes(w)).length;
    if (matchCount === 0) {
      issues.push(`No key entities from bet found in source text. Bet words: [${keyWords.slice(0, 5).join(', ')}]`);
      maybeDrop('entity_mismatch', 'VALIDATOR_ENTITY_MISMATCH', { keyWords: keyWords.slice(0, 5) });
      return { valid: false, issues, reason: 'entity_mismatch' };
    }
  }
}
```

The brand-name check **just below** at lines 1314–1336 honours `hasMedia` via `brandExempt`. The entity-mismatch check above does not. For HRB image shares the source text is "Check out this bet I placed on Hard Rock Bet! …" and the bet entities live in the image — so `matchCount === 0` is guaranteed, even when the AI correctly extracted the bet. This killed message `1495523909972267221`.

### 4.5 Three early returns in `processAggregatedMessage` lack instrumentation

[messageHandler.js:990, 1035, 1080](handlers/messageHandler.js:990):
- line 990: `await autoGradeBet(...); return;` after `parsed.type === 'result'` — no `pipeline_event` emitted on return.
- line 1035: `await sendUntrackedWinEmbed(...); return;` after `parsed.type === 'untracked_win'` — no event emitted.
- line 1080: `return;` after the recap/ticket-status auto-grade branch — no event emitted, even though the function may have just graded N bets.

These are not the cause of the current drops (none of the 5 ig-dave-picks messages reached these branches — `parsed.type='ignore'` and `parsed.type='bet'` were the only outcomes seen) but they are real instrumentation blind spots that would resurface as "silent drop" reports the next time someone posts a result/celebration/recap shape.

### 4.6 No channel-specific branching

`grep -n "1355182920163262664\|1473347391284576469\|datdude\|ig-dave\|IgDave\|DatDude" services/*.js handlers/*.js commands/*.js bot.js` returns only two comment lines in [bot.js:212](bot.js:212) and [bot.js:215](bot.js:215). No conditional logic anywhere in the production path branches on either channel id or capper name. **H2 falsified at the code level.**

---

## Section 5 — Hypothesis ranking

| # | Hypothesis | Likelihood | Rationale | Falsification test |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H1 | Buffer key collision between two channels by same author | **L** | Buffer key includes `channelId`; impossible to collide cross-channel. ([messageHandler.js:29](handlers/messageHandler.js:29)) | Add a temporary log of `messageBuffer.size` and key set on each `bufferMessage` call; observe two simultaneous keys when DatDude posts to both channels. |
| H2 | Channel-specific branch in some downstream gate | **L** | No code references either channel id; all per-channel config (humans, picks, capper map) is symmetric. | grep already done, returns nothing. |
| H3 | Race condition: vision result arrives after war-room embed for the other channel | **L** | Channels are processed independently; no shared buffer or shared parsed-result store. | N/A — already excluded by code structure. |
| H4 | Vision AI returns `type: 'ignore'` for HRB image shares; Gemma fallback doesn't trigger on ignore verdict | **H** | 4 of 5 traced messages dropped here. Gemma fallback gate at [services/ai.js:879](services/ai.js:879) excludes `type: 'ignore'`. | Force-feed an HRB share image+text to `parseBetText` with logging of fallback triggers; expect Gemini→ignore, no fallback. |
| H5 | DatDude has not posted in `#datdude-slips` since v289 deployed (or bot is not receiving from that channel) | **H** | Zero `pipeline_events` rows since 2026-04-17; backlog "ENTRY fires" claim was not re-verified post-v289. | User posts a fresh test message in `#datdude-slips`; check for a RECEIVED `pipeline_event` within seconds. |
| H6 | `validateParsedBet` entity-mismatch check ignores `hasMedia` and kills image-only bets | **M** | Killed 1 of 5 ig-dave-picks messages. Brand check on the same function honours `hasMedia`; entity check inconsistently does not. | Patch `if (src.length > 10 && desc.length > 10 && !hasMedia)` and replay the dropped message via offline harness. |

H4 and H5 are the load-bearing hypotheses. H4 is observable in the data; H5 needs a fresh test post.

## Section 6 — Proposed minimal fix (NOT WRITTEN)

**Primary fix — H4.** Trigger the existing Gemma+Cerebras vision fallback when:
- an image was provided, AND
- the primary returned `type: 'ignore'`, AND
- the source text contains a known sportsbook share URL (HRB, DK, FanDuel, Caesars, BetMGM, PrizePicks, Underdog).

**File / line:** [services/ai.js:879–887](services/ai.js:879).

Current code (lines 879–887):
```js
if (raw && !hasPlaceholder) {
  try {
    const quick = parseJSON(raw);
    if (quick && (quick.type === 'bet' || quick.is_bet === true)) {
      const bets = Array.isArray(quick.bets) ? quick.bets : [];
      noLegsFound = bets.length === 0 || !bets.some(b => Array.isArray(b.legs) && b.legs.length > 0);
    }
  } catch (_) {}
}
```

Proposed code (same range):
```js
if (raw && !hasPlaceholder) {
  try {
    const quick = parseJSON(raw);
    if (quick && (quick.type === 'bet' || quick.is_bet === true)) {
      const bets = Array.isArray(quick.bets) ? quick.bets : [];
      noLegsFound = bets.length === 0 || !bets.some(b => Array.isArray(b.legs) && b.legs.length > 0);
    }
    // Image present + AI says ignore + source text has a sportsbook
    // share URL → high-confidence the bet lives in the image and the
    // wrapper text fooled the anti-promo rule. Force the Gemma chain.
    if (quick && quick.type === 'ignore'
        && /share\.hardrock\.bet|draftkings\.com|sportsbook\.fanduel\.com|caesars\.com\/sportsbook|betmgm\.com|prizepicks\.com|underdogfantasy\.com/i.test(text || '')) {
      noLegsFound = true;
    }
  } catch (_) {}
}
```

**Why this fixes the divergence.** The 4 dropped HRB-share messages all match this condition (image + `type: 'ignore'` + `share.hardrock.bet` in text). Forcing the fallback runs Gemma→Cerebras on the image, which is a separate pipeline less prone to the anti-promo bias.

**New `pipeline_event` to add post-deploy.** When fallback runs, emit a `recordStage` at stage `EXTRACTED` with `payload.fallback='gemma_chain_forced'` so the new path is observable. (Suggested addition; not part of the minimal one-block change above.)

**Risk / blast radius.**
- The fallback is already in production for null/placeholder/no-legs cases. Adding one more trigger only changes which messages enter it; it does not alter what the fallback does.
- Cost: a few extra Gemma+Cerebras calls for sportsbook-share-URL messages that the primary classified as ignore. Volume is low (current rate ≈ 1–2/day across all channels per the 5 ig-dave-picks traces over 4 days).
- Regression risk: minimal. Other cappers (Twitter relays via `TWITTER_CAPPER_MAP`) post text containing the actual bet entities, not a sportsbook share URL — they will not match the regex and their behavior does not change.
- Cross-channel impact: applies to any channel where users post HRB / DK / FanDuel share URLs. Likely beneficial across the board.

**Secondary fix — H6 (one-liner).** [services/ai.js:1289](services/ai.js:1289) — add `&& !hasMedia` to the outer guard so the entity-mismatch check is skipped on image-bearing messages, paralleling the brand-exempt path. This salvages bets where Vision AI succeeded but the wrapper text doesn't echo the bet entities. Lower priority than H4 (1 of 5 vs 4 of 5), can ship in the same PR or as a follow-up.

**Out of scope for this fix.** The three uninstrumented early returns at messageHandler.js:990, 1035, 1080 are real blind spots but did not cause the observed drops. Filed as Section 7 follow-up rather than bundled into the minimal fix.

## Section 7 — Open questions

1. **Has DatDudeStill posted any message in `#datdude-slips` since v289 deployed (2026-04-17)?** Pipeline_events shows zero RECEIVED events for that channel. The "MessageHandler.ENTRY fires" claim in the backlog was almost certainly observed pre-v289. Need either a fresh test post (user-side) or `console.log` greps from Fly logs covering 2026-04-17 onward to confirm whether the gateway is delivering messages from that channel to the bot.
2. **Is the bot's view/read permission on `#datdude-slips` intact at the Discord channel-permissions layer?** Env config (`HUMAN_SUBMISSION_CHANNEL_IDS`, `CAPPER_CHANNEL_MAP`) lists both channel ids, but Discord channel permissions are independent of bot env config. A perms regression would silently stop MessageCreate delivery without any log line. User-side verification.
3. **The `evaluateTweet` pre-filter at [services/ai.js:1092](services/ai.js:1092) currently returns `reject_recap` for plain HRB share boilerplate ("Check out this bet I placed on Hard Rock Bet!").** The call site at [messageHandler.js:937](handlers/messageHandler.js:937) only acts on `reject_settled`, so `reject_recap` doesn't drop. But it's a latent footgun — if a future change starts honouring `reject_recap`, every HRB share will die at the pre-filter. Worth a comment on the call site clarifying intent.
4. **Should H6 (validator `hasMedia` parity) ship in the same PR as the H4 fix, or wait for production data on H4 alone?** Tightly related but independent code paths. Author's call.
5. **The single successful ig-dave-picks bet (2026-04-06) had identical wrapper text to the failed messages.** What changed between 2026-04-06 and 2026-04-17 that flipped Vision AI's behavior on this exact-shape input? Possibilities: prompt update in `parseBetText`, model swap in `callLLM`, or just AI nondeterminism crossing a threshold. `git log services/ai.js` between those dates would narrow it.
6. **Three uninstrumented early returns at processAggregatedMessage — file as a separate cleanup commit?** Specifically:
   - [messageHandler.js:990](handlers/messageHandler.js:990) (autograde result)
   - [messageHandler.js:1035](handlers/messageHandler.js:1035) (untracked_win)
   - [messageHandler.js:1080](handlers/messageHandler.js:1080) (recap auto-grade)
   Each should emit a `recordStage('STAGE_EXIT', payload: { branch: '...', graded: N })` so future "silent drop" reports on result/celebration messages are immediately diagnosable.

`skills/zonetracker-regrade/scripts/run-fly-sql.sh` — readonly SQL helper for `bettracker.db` on Fly. Mirrors `pull-single-bet.sh`'s pattern (local JS file → sftp → ssh console node) to avoid quote-escape collisions. Refuses any string containing `INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|DROP|CREATE|ALTER|REPLACE|TRUNCATE` client-side, before sending to Fly. SQL is base64-encoded into the temp script so it survives nested quoting unchanged. Used for every query in this report.
